      This will include the title of the game, New User? Name, email, password, pass conf, and signup button -this will be a form-
    Then it will ask coming back?
  another form which will include email, password, and sign in button.

Lastly, we want to know if we will create a guest check in button for recruiters. I read somewhere that they want a guest check in if they do not want to lose time logging in-->

<!-- This will be the title -->
<!-- eventually, I want to make this title a container so that I am able to make it: something like this to make it pretty:
<div class="container">
      <div class="row center">
        <h1 class="title col-12">Tic Tac Toe</h1>
      </div> -->
<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>


<!-- I want to separate the sections with before-sign-in, which will be the login page. after-sign-in which will be the home page, the start-game page that will include the game board, and lastly, the outcome-page which will include the results, and the button to play another game.  -->
