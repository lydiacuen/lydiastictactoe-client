<!-- Description of the app -->
I created a single page app using HTML and CSS. I used Javascript and jQuery to interact with the app through the DOM. I used Ajax to talk to the API. 
The game is a tic tac toe game. You sign up, sign in, and you can start playing the game. You can reset the game at any time, and you can also sign out after you are done.
